FoxPro DOS window fun in a browser

## Demo
Try it out: [FoxPro DOS Simulator](https://carledwards.github.io/foxpro-js/)

## Background
This project started as a learning exercise in building a DOS-style canvas in JavaScript. It's my tribute to FoxPro DOS, which was one of the most sophisticated and well-designed DOS-based UI applications of its time. FoxPro set a high bar for DOS user interfaces, demonstrating that character-based applications could be both powerful and user-friendly.

The simulator recreates some of FoxPro's distinctive UI elements including:
- Multiple window management
- Animated windows
- Character-based drawing
- Original burgundy color scheme
